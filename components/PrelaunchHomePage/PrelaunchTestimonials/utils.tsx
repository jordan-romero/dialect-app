      "This is absolutely the dialect coach you've been looking for. Scott's method teaches you the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) - an easy-to-learn cheat sheet that when mastered, allows you to speak in any dialect you can think of. Over the course of 10 months, Scott taught me 11 vastly different accents, while only doing one session per week - and yet I'm comfortable enough to pop into any of those accents at a moment's notice. He teaches at your pace but pushes you just enough to make sure you're getting what you want (and more!) out of his class. I can't recommend Scott enough!",

      "I had only a vague notion of the IPA before taking Scott's class. Not only did I develop an improved understanding of what sounds are produced by different geographies, it helped me appreciate my own collection of sounds and unconscious inflections. Most importantly, I came away with a method or system to break down the sounds of any speaker and confidently apply them to a role. Scott exceeds his peers in drawing and focusing upon the vast amount of information on the subject and allows his student to quickly get to the key issues of utilizing the IPA. From Shakespeare to a Scottish Nanny, Scott will have you sounding authentic before you know it. In addition to getting a lot out of the class, I have enjoyed it and would recommend it to any actor looking to add accents to their range.",

      "As an actor, accents are an integral part of creating a character. Scott teaches you a technical fail-proof way to hone in on ANY accent and be able to perform it without self-doubt of 'Is this right?' He teaches you the tools to do any accent authentically, and you'll have a blast doing it! Not only does he care about your progress, but he's always available to help you if you have questions. I highly recommend Scott's dialect class, and if you're serious about your craft, this is a MUST. A great investment that will pay off your entire career. I can't wait to bring what I learned in Scott's dialect class to set!",

Scott's class went above and beyond in making learning the IPA incredibly fun...whatever roles that may come my way, I am confident that Scott's training has given me the tools needed to nail it.",

      'My goal was to not sound so Canadian. Scott was quickly able to identify my shortcomings and was able to coach using the IPA and his well-diverse knowledge of accents and language. I can happily say that I reached my goal and then some. Scott also coached me through many last-minute auditions that required accents such as Greek, Irish, Boston -- you name it, we did it! My confidence grew, and my bookings increased dramatically. Mission accomplished.',

With Scott, I have been able to learn any dialect with the IPA WHICH IS SO UNDERRATED! I truly believe this skill has so many benefits, one being you can get into character much more confidently and authentically. My classes with Scott have been some of my favorite memories in LA.',

      "Before finding this class, I did a LOT of research in an effort to find some course where I could learn IPA. Unless you are enrolled in a university, there simply is a void in this market...I went to a top drama school, but Scott's approach to dialects is different. I feel this is a more technical approach to dialects than mimicry is, and it satisfies my own need to feel like I've covered all my bases or done due diligence in preparing for a role...This class is a hidden gem.",

      "Scott is such a pro. After learning the IPA system with him in a time-efficient way, I've tackled over 7 accents with Scott. Using the resources & skills he has taught me, I would even have the confidence to turn around any accent overnight. Not only does he have an amazing ear and skill set, but he understands the nuances of every accent, as well as behaviors that helped me nail auditions. He's also a delightful person and actor. He's super supportive, and his database of resources is unmatched. Whether it's to coach quickly or to learn accents to have in the back pocket, Scott is my go-to guy- I can't recommend him enough!",

His teaching technique employs a great combo of patience & pushing you out of your comfort zone, and he was very accommodating to my needs as someone with dyslexia. His one-on-one coaching sessions were always very fun with lots of room for being silly, messing up and getting back on the horse again. Can’t recommend him enough!',

It’s helped me create much fuller, more accurate versions of the dialects I had previously been trying to learn by ear alone. Ultimately, working with Scott has given me the confidence to learn any dialect, make it my own, and (most importantly) bring it into audition & performance situations.",
